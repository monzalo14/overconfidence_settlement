  abstract={Using manufacturing data for India, this paper studies the economic effects of legal amendments on two types of labor laws: employment protection and labor dispute resolution legislation. We find that laws that increase employment protection or the cost of labor disputes substantially reduce registered sector employment and output. These laws do no seem to benefit workers either, as they do not increase the share of value added that goes to labor. Labor-intensive industries, such as textiles, are the hardest hit by amendments that increase employment protection while capital-intensive industries are the most affected by laws that increase the cost of labor dispute resolution. These adverse effects are not alleviated by the widespread and increasing use of contract labor, particularly in regards to employment. Results are robust to an alternative codification of legal amendments suggested by Bhattacharjea (2006).},

  abstract={We analyze the outcomes of 332 cases from a labor court in Mexico in which a judge awarded money to a plaintiff who claimed to have been fired by a firm without cause. The judgments were enforced in only 40\% of the cases. A plaintiff may try to enforce a judgment by petitioning the court to seize the firm's assets when the firm refuses to pay. Thirty eight percent of the enforced judgments required at least one seizure attempt. We estimate the parameters of post judgment games in which the worker does not know if a seizure attempt would ultimately succeed and show that these models explain the data well. We then simulate the effects of a policy that reduces worker costs of a seizure attempt. We find that this policy would increase the probability of enforcement, either by increasing the probability that the worker attempts an asset seizure or by inducing firms to pay voluntarily to avoid such seizure attempts. However, reducing worker costs of seizure attempts can only have a modest effect on enforcement probabilities because a high percentage of firms are able to avoid payment in spite of worker efforts to force collection.},

  abstract={Methods of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) have become increasing popular relative to court litigation for a wide variety of disputes. Among various types of ADR, the conciliation method of dispute resolution has received less attention as compared to arbitration method. Using a newly obtained from Labour Tribunal in India, the present study focus on the relevance of conciliation method in labour dispute resolution and examine the impact of mandatory and non-mandatory conciliation mechanisms on the negotiated settlement and dispute resolution time. Results obtained from this study indicate that, at an aggregate level, labour conflicts settled in the mandatory conciliation process take less time than those cases appeal in the labour courts. The study also confirms that the overall mandatory conciliation process are succeed in reducing differences in final payments received by workers and in improving their settlement rates as compared to cases proceeded to appeal. At a disaggregate level, disputes settled in the pre reform period experience reduction total disposition time.

 abstract = {Enforcement of labor regulations in the formal sector may drive workers to informality because they increase the costs of formal labor. But better compliance with mandated benefits makes it attractive to be a formal employee. We show that, in locations with frequent inspections, workers pay for mandated benefits by receiving lower wages. Wage rigidity prevents downward adjustment at the bottom of the wage distribution. As a result, lower paid formal sector jobs become attractive to some informal workers, inducing them to want to move to the formal sector.},

  abstract={This paper investigates whether the industrial relations climate in Indian States has affected the pattern of manufacturing growth in the period 1958-92. We show that pro-worker amendments to the Industrial Disputes Act are associated with lowered investment, employment, productivity and output in registered manufacturing. Regulating in a pro-worker direction is also associated with increases in urban poverty. This suggests that attempts to redress the balance of power between capital and labour can end up hurting the poor.},

year = {2016}, 
doi = {10.1093/qje/qjw015}, 
abstract ={We exploit variation in the congestion of civil courts across Brazilian municipalities, together with a bankruptcy reform increasing secured creditors’ protection, to estimate the effect of enforcement on firm access to finance, investment and size. We find that firms operating in municipalities with less congested courts experienced larger increase in the use of secured loans, as well as a larger increase in investment and value of output in the years after the reform. To establish the direction of causality, we use an instrumental variable strategy that exploits Brazilian state laws on judicial organization, and focus on differences in court congestion across otherwise similar neighboring municipalities located across judicial district borders within the same state. Together, the evidence indicates that differences in court enforcement affect the impact of financial reform on firm access to finance, investment and size.},

  abstract={Using a newly assembled data set on procedures filed in Mexican labor tribunals, we study the determinants of final awards to workers. On average, workers recover less than 30\% of their claim. Our strongest result is that workers receive higher percentages of their claims in settlements than in trial judgments. We also find that cases with multiple claimants against a single firm are less likely to be settled, which partially explains why workers involved in these procedures receive lower percentages of their claims. Finally, we find evidence that a worker who exaggerates her claim is less likely to settle.},

  note={The number of individual disputes arising from day-to-day workers’ grievances or complaints continues to grow in many parts of the world. The chapters in this book cover individual labour dispute settlement systems in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. Each chapter examines and assesses the institutions and mechanisms for settlement of individual labour disputes, including the procedures and powers available, the interaction of these institutions and mechanisms with other labour market institutions (e.g. collective bargaining and labour inspection) and the broader system for resolution of legal disputes (e.g. courts of general jurisdiction, specialist commissions and tribunals).},

 ISSN = {00389765},
 URL = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/1229164},
 abstract = {Many analysts and courts have made alternative dispute resolution (ADR) a key feature of proposals for civil justice reform. Professor Rosenberg and Dean Folberg were advisors to a task force which commissioned a study of the ADR program in the Northern District of California. This article presents the authors' extensive findings and recommendations. During the 4-year period studied, the district used an ADR process called early neutral evaluation (ENE), to which half of the cases in certain types of suits were assigned. Two-thirds of those assigned to ENE were satisfied with the process and believed it was worth the resources devoted to it; half of those assigned to ENE saved money, with average savings exceeding ten times the cost of an ENE session; and about half of the cases in which ENE sessions were held were resolved more quickly than cases not assigned to the ENE program. Despite the fact that over 80 percent of attorneys assigned to ENE reported that they would select ENE in other cases, no one whose case was not automatically assigned to ENE asked to have the case assigned, even though that option was available and known. The key predictors of a successful ENE outcome were the attitude and skills of the neutral evaluator. A number of the authors' recommendations thus focus on selecting and retaining effective neutrals.},
